# Employee-payroll-System
I developed a full-stack web application using React.js, Next.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The project focuses on automating salary processing, tax calculation, and leave tracking for employees. Admins can view employee attendance, approve leave requests, and manage payroll data. Employees can apply for leave and download their pay slips
